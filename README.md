Documentation of my practical semestre which I absolved in SS18.
This project contains:

- `main.tex`: The main LaTeX-file. Here, all the "text" can be found.
- `format/packages.tex`: A file to include all important packages.
- `format/code.tex`: A file to define a good-looking source code environment using the package `lstlistings`.
