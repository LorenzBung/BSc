# hw3

## Tasks

To fulfill **hw3** you have to solve:

- simu1
- simu2
- simu3
- simu4

## ASIDE: SIMULATION HOMEWORKS

Simulation homeworks (`simuN/`) come in the form of simulators you run to make
sure you understand some piece of the material. The simulators are generally
python programs that enable you both to generate different problems (using
different random seeds) as well as to have the program solve the problem for you
(with the `-c` flag) so that you can check your answers. Running any simulator
with a `-h` or `--help`flag will provide with more information as to all the
options the simulator gives you.

The README provided with each simulator gives more detail as to how to run it.
Each flag is described in some detail therein.

You find all Files for your simulation homework in the `simuN/` directory.

**IMPORTANT**: This time, there is no possibility to give more
explanations/comments  AFTER the Code Review. You have to give all the asked
explanations and comments (in German or English) before the code review.

The code review starts after the deadline, so you have enough time to extend
your answers, if your Pull-Request was quite early. After the deadline there
will be no review process (as you already now). This time the review helps you
to only correct your answers in cases, where you solved a problem in a wrong
way.

## Pull-Request

Please merge any accepted reviews into your branch. If you are ready with the
homework, all tests run, please create a pull request named **hw3**.
